You're working as a radio broadcasting station operator in soviet-occupied Poland. 
You have lots of power and great responsibility.
Will you be smart and brave enough to get rid of this fatal establishment and finally set the country free? 
Emit proper radio programs to influence people in polish cities, react properly for various fascinating historical (and fictional) events and splendidly avoid government agents, so you don't end up as a public enemy. 
Become the master of propaganda. 
Let the waves of freedom flow!
